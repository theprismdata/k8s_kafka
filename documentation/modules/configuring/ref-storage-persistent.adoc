= Persistent storage

Persistent storage uses {K8sPersistentVolumeClaims} to provision persistent volumes for storing data.
Persistent Volume Claims can be used to provision volumes of many different types, depending on the {K8SStorageClass} which will provision the volume.
The data types which can be used with persistent volume claims include many types of SAN storage as well as {K8sLocalPersistentVolumes}.

To use persistent storage, the `type` has to be set to `persistent-claim`.
Persistent storage supports additional configuration options:

`id` (optional)::
Storage identification number. This option is mandatory for storage volumes defined in a JBOD storage declaration.
Default is `0`.

`size` (required)::
Defines the size of the persistent volume claim, for example, "1000Gi".

`class` (optional)::
The Kubernetes {K8SStorageClass} to use for dynamic volume provisioning.

`selector` (optional)::
Allows selecting a specific persistent volume to use.
It contains key:value pairs representing labels for selecting such a volume.

`deleteClaim` (optional)::
Boolean value which specifies if the Persistent Volume Claim has to be deleted when the cluster is undeployed.
Default is `false`.

WARNING: Increasing the size of persistent volumes in an existing Strimzi cluster is only supported in Kubernetes versions that support persistent volume resizing. The persistent volume to be resized must use a storage class that supports volume expansion.
For other versions of Kubernetes and storage classes which do not support volume expansion, you must decide the necessary storage size before deploying the cluster.
Decreasing the size of existing persistent volumes is not possible.

[source,yaml]
----
# ...
storage:
  type: persistent-claim
  size: 1000Gi

The following example demonstrates the use of a storage class.

storage:
  type: persistent-claim
  size: 1Gi

Finally, a `selector` can be used to select a specific labeled persistent volume to provide needed features such as an SSD.

== Storage class overrides

You can specify a different storage class for one or more Kafka brokers or ZooKeeper nodes, instead of using the default storage class.
This is useful if, for example, storage classes are restricted to different availability zones or data centers.
You can use the `overrides` field for this purpose.

In this example, the default storage class is named `my-storage-class`:

.Example Strimzi cluster using storage class overrides
[source,yaml,subs="attributes+"]
----
apiVersion: {KafkaApiVersion}
kind: Kafka
metadata:
  labels:
    app: my-cluster
  name: my-cluster
  namespace: myproject
spec:
  # ...
  kafka:
    replicas: 3
    storage:
      deleteClaim: true
      size: 100Gi
      type: persistent-claim
      class: my-storage-class
      overrides:
        - broker: 0
          class: my-storage-class-zone-1a
        - broker: 1
          class: my-storage-class-zone-1b
        - broker: 2
          class: my-storage-class-zone-1c
  # ...
  zookeeper:
    replicas: 3
    storage:
      deleteClaim: true
      size: 100Gi
      type: persistent-claim
      class: my-storage-class
      overrides:
        - broker: 0
          class: my-storage-class-zone-1a
        - broker: 1
          class: my-storage-class-zone-1b
        - broker: 2
          class: my-storage-class-zone-1c
  # ...
----

As a result of the configured `overrides` property, the volumes use the following storage classes:

* The persistent volumes of ZooKeeper node 0 will use `my-storage-class-zone-1a`.
* The persistent volumes of ZooKeeper node 1 will use `my-storage-class-zone-1b`.
* The persistent volumes of ZooKeeepr node 2 will use `my-storage-class-zone-1c`.
* The persistent volumes of Kafka broker 0 will use `my-storage-class-zone-1a`.
* The persistent volumes of Kafka broker 1 will use `my-storage-class-zone-1b`.
* The persistent volumes of Kafka broker 2 will use `my-storage-class-zone-1c`.

The `overrides` property is currently used only to override storage class configurations. Overriding other storage configuration fields is not currently supported.
Other fields from the storage configuration are currently not supported.

== Persistent Volume Claim naming

When persistent storage is used, it creates Persistent Volume Claims with the following names:

`data-_cluster-name_-kafka-_idx_`::
Persistent Volume Claim for the volume used for storing data for the Kafka broker pod `_idx_`.

`data-_cluster-name_-zookeeper-_idx_`::
Persistent Volume Claim for the volume used for storing data for the ZooKeeper node pod `_idx_`.

== Log directories

The persistent volume is used by the Kafka brokers as log directories mounted into the following path:

[source,shell,subs="+quotes,attributes"]
----
/var/lib/kafka/data/kafka-log__IDX__
----

Where `_IDX_` is the Kafka broker pod index. For example `/var/lib/kafka/data/kafka-log0`.
