`_cluster-name_-kafka-_pod-id_`:: Service used to route traffic from outside the Kubernetes cluster to individual pods. This resource is created only when an external listener is enabled. The old service name will be used for backwards compatibility when the listener name is `external` and port is `9094`.
`_cluster-name_-kafka-external-bootstrap`:: Bootstrap route for clients connecting from outside the Kubernetes cluster. This resource is created only when an external listener is enabled and set to type `route`. The old route name will be used for backwards compatibility when the listener name is `external` and port is `9094`.
`_cluster-name_-kafka-_pod-id_`:: Route for traffic from outside the Kubernetes cluster to individual pods. This resource is created only when an external listener is enabled and set to type `route`. The old route name will be used for backwards compatibility when the listener name is `external` and port is `9094`.
`_cluster-name_-kafka-_listener-name_-bootstrap`:: Bootstrap service for clients connecting from outside the Kubernetes cluster. This resource is created only when an external listener is enabled. The new service name will be used for all other external listeners.
`_cluster-name_-kafka-_listener-name_-_pod-id_`:: Service used to route traffic from outside the Kubernetes cluster to individual pods. This resource is created only when an external listener is enabled. The new service name will be used for all other external listeners.
`_cluster-name_-kafka-_listener-name_-bootstrap`:: Bootstrap route for clients connecting from outside the Kubernetes cluster. This resource is created only when an external listener is enabled and set to type `route`. The new route name will be used for all other external listeners.
`_cluster-name_-kafka-_listener-name_-_pod-id_`:: Route for traffic from outside the Kubernetes cluster to individual pods. This resource is created only when an external listener is enabled and set to type `route`. The new route name will be used for all other external listeners.
