= Securing a Kafka MirrorMaker 2.0 deployment

[role="_abstract"]
This procedure describes in outline the configuration required to secure a MirrorMaker 2.0 deployment.

You need separate configuration for the source Kafka cluster and the target Kafka cluster.
You also need separate user configuration to provide the credentials required for MirrorMaker to connect to the source and target Kafka clusters.

For the Kafka clusters, you specify internal listeners for secure connections within a Kubernetes cluster and external listeners for connections outside the Kubernetes cluster.

You can configure authentication and authorization mechanisms.
The security options implemented for the source and target Kafka clusters must be compatible with the security options implemented for MirrorMaker 2.0.

After you have created the cluster and user authentication credentials, you specify them in your MirrorMaker configuration for secure connections.

NOTE: In this procedure, the certificates generated by the Cluster Operator are used, but you can replace them by xref:installing-your-own-ca-certificates-str[installing your own certificates].
You can also configure your listener to xref:kafka-listener-certificates-str[use a Kafka listener certificate managed by an external Certificate Authority].

.Before you start
Before starting this procedure, take a look at the link:{BookURLDeploying}#deploy-examples-{context}[example configuration files^] provided by Strimzi.
They include examples for securing a deployment of MirrorMaker 2.0 using TLS or SCRAM-SHA-512 authentication.
The examples specify internal listeners for connecting within a Kubernetes cluster.

The examples also show the ACLs needed by MirrorMaker 2.0 to allow operations on the source and target Kafka clusters.

.Prerequisites

* Strimzi is running
* Separate namespaces for source and target clusters

The procedure assumes that the source and target Kafka clusters are installed to separate namespaces
If you want to use the Topic Operator, you'll need to do this.
The Topic Operator only watches a single cluster in a specified namespace.

By separating the clusters into namespaces, you will need to copy the cluster secrets so they can be accessed outside the namespace.
You need to reference the secrets in the MirrorMaker configuration.

.Procedure

. Configure two `Kafka` resources, one to secure the source Kafka cluster and one to secure the target Kafka cluster.
+
You can add listener configuration for authentication and enable authorization.
+
In this example, an internal listener is configured for a Kafka cluster with TLS encryption and authentication.
Kafka `simple` authorization is enabled.

. Create or update the `Kafka` resources in separate namespaces.

----
+
The Cluster Operator creates the listeners and sets up the cluster and client certificate authority (CA) certificates to enable authentication within the Kafka cluster.
+
The certificates are created in the secret `_<cluster_name>_-cluster-ca-cert`.

. Configure two `KafkaUser` resources, one for a user of the source Kafka cluster and one for a user of the target Kafka cluster.
+
--
.. Configure the same authentication and authorization types as the corresponding source and target Kafka cluster.
For example, if you used `tls` authentication and `simple` authorization type in the `Kafka` configuration for the source Kafka cluster,
use the same in the `KafkaUser` configuration.

.. Configure the ACLs needed by MirrorMaker 2.0 to allow operations on the source and target Kafka clusters.
+
The ACLs are used by the internal MirrorMaker connectors, and by the underlying Kafka Connect framework.

NOTE: You can use a certificate issued outside the User Operator by setting `type` to `tls-external`.
For more information, see xref:con-securing-client-authentication-str[User authentication].

. Create or update a `KafkaUser` resource in each of the namespaces you created for the source and target Kafka clusters.
+
[source,shell,subs=+quotes]
----
kubectl apply -f _<kafka_user_configuration_file>_ -n _<namespace>_
----
+
The User Operator creates the users representing the client (MirrorMaker), and the security credentials used for client authentication, based on the chosen authentication type.
+
The User Operator creates a new secret with the same name as the `KafkaUser` resource.
The secret contains a private and public key for TLS client authentication.
The public key is contained in a user certificate, which is signed by the client Certificate Authority (CA).

. Configure a `KafkaMirrorMaker2` resource with the authentication details to connect to the source and target Kafka clusters.
