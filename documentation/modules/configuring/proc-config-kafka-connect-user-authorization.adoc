= Configuring Kafka Connect user authorization

This procedure describes how to authorize user access to Kafka Connect.

When any type of authorization is being used in Kafka, a Kafka Connect user requires read/write access rights to the consumer group
and the internal topics of Kafka Connect.

The properties for the consumer group and internal topics are automatically configured by Strimzi,
or they can be specified explicitly in the `spec` of the `KafkaConnect` resource.

.Example configuration properties in the `KafkaConnect` resource
[source,yaml,subs=attributes+]
----
apiVersion: {KafkaConnectApiVersion}
kind: KafkaConnect
metadata:
  name: my-connect
spec:
  # ...
  config:
    group.id: my-connect-cluster <1>
    offset.storage.topic: my-connect-cluster-offsets <2>
    config.storage.topic: my-connect-cluster-configs <3>
    status.storage.topic: my-connect-cluster-status <4>
    # ...
  # ...
----
<1> The Kafka Connect cluster ID within Kafka.
<2> Kafka topic that stores connector offsets.
<3> Kafka topic that stores connector and task status configurations.
<4> Kafka topic that stores connector and task status updates.

This procedure shows how access is provided when `simple` authorization is being used.

Simple authorization uses ACL rules, handled by the Kafka `AclAuthorizer` plugin, to provide the right level of access.
For more information on configuring a `KafkaUser` resource to use simple authorization, see the xref:type-AclRule-reference[`AclRule` schema reference].

NOTE: The default values for the consumer group and topics will differ when xref:con-kafka-connect-multiple-instances-{context}[running multiple instances].

.Prerequisites

* A Kubernetes cluster
* A running Cluster Operator

.Procedure

. Edit the `authorization` property in the `KafkaUser` resource to provide access rights to the user.
+
In the following example, access rights are configured for the Kafka Connect topics and consumer group using `literal` name values:
+
[table,stripes=none]
|===
|Property |Name

|`offset.storage.topic`
|`connect-cluster-offsets`

|`status.storage.topic`
|`connect-cluster-status`

|`config.storage.topic`
|`connect-cluster-configs`

|`group`
|`connect-cluster`
