= JBOD storage overview

[role="_abstract"]
You can configure Strimzi to use JBOD, a data storage configuration of multiple disks or volumes. JBOD is one approach to providing increased data storage for Kafka brokers. It can also improve performance.

A JBOD configuration is described by one or more volumes, each of which can be either xref:ref-ephemeral-storage-{context}[ephemeral] or xref:ref-persistent-storage-{context}[persistent]. The rules and constraints for JBOD volume declarations are the same as those for ephemeral and persistent storage. For example, you cannot decrease the size of a persistent storage volume after it has been provisioned, or you cannot change the value of `sizeLimit` when type=ephemeral.

== JBOD configuration

To use JBOD with Strimzi, the storage `type` must be set to `jbod`. The `volumes` property allows you to describe the disks that make up your JBOD storage array or configuration. The following fragment shows an example JBOD configuration:

[source,yaml]
----
# ...
storage:
  type: jbod
  volumes:
  - id: 0
    type: persistent-claim
    size: 100Gi
    deleteClaim: false
  - id: 1
    type: persistent-claim
    size: 100Gi
    deleteClaim: false
# ...
----

The ids cannot be changed once the JBOD volumes are created.

Users can add or remove volumes from the JBOD configuration.

== JBOD and Persistent Volume Claims

When persistent storage is used to declare JBOD volumes, the naming scheme of the resulting Persistent Volume Claims is as follows:

`data-_id_-_cluster-name_-kafka-_idx_`::

Where `_id_` is the ID of the volume used for storing data for Kafka broker pod `_idx_`.

== Log directories

The JBOD volumes will be used by the Kafka brokers as log directories mounted into the following path:

`/var/lib/kafka/data-_id_/kafka-log_idx_`::
Where `_id_` is the ID of the volume used for storing data for Kafka broker pod `_idx_`. For example `/var/lib/kafka/data-0/kafka-log0`.
