= Monitoring operators using Prometheus metrics

Strimzi operators expose Prometheus metrics.
The metrics are automatically enabled and contain information about:

* Number of reconciliations
* Number of Custom Resources the operator is processing
* Duration of reconciliations
* JVM metrics from the operators

Additionally, we provide an example Grafana dashboard.

For more information about Prometheus, see the link:{BookURLDeploying}#assembly-metrics-{context}[Introducing Metrics to Kafka] in the _Deploying and Upgrading Strimzi_ guide.
