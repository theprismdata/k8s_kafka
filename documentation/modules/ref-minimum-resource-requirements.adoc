== Cluster Operator resource requirements

Testing has shown that the Cluster Operator functions adequately with 256Mi of memory and 200m CPU when watching two clusters.
It is therefore recommended to use these as a minimum when configuring resource requests and not to run it with lower limits than these.
Configuring more generous limits is recommended only in special situations, when the Cluster Operator is controlling multiple clusters.

[id='topic-operator-resource-requirements-{context}']
== Topic Operator resource requirements

Testing has shown that the Topic Operator requires a minimum of 96Mi of memory and 100m CPU.
It is therefore recommended to use these as a minimum when configuring resource requests and not to run it with lower limits than these. 
If the Kafka cluster has a large amount of topics, the resource request and limits should be increased as necessary.
