= Discovering services using labels and annotations

Service discovery makes it easier for client applications running in the same Kubernetes cluster as Strimzi to interact with a Kafka cluster.

A _service discovery_ label and annotation is generated for services used to access the Kafka cluster:

* Internal Kafka bootstrap service
* HTTP Bridge service

The label helps to make the service discoverable, and the annotation provides connection details that a client application can use to make the connection.

The service discovery label, `strimzi.io/discovery`, is set as `true` for the `Service` resources.
The service discovery annotation has the same key, providing connection details in JSON format for each service.

== Returning connection details on services

You can find the services by specifying the discovery label when fetching services from the command line or a corresponding API call.

[source,yaml]
----
kubectl get service -l strimzi.io/discovery=true
----

The connection details are returned when retrieving the service discovery label.
