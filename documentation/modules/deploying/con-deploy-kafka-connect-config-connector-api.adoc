= APIs for creating and managing connectors

[role="_abstract"]
Strimzi provides two APIs for creating and managing connectors:

* `KafkaConnector` custom resources (referred to as KafkaConnectors)
* The Kafka Connect REST API

Using the APIs, you can:

* Check the status of a connector instance
* Reconfigure a running connector
* Increase or decrease the number of connector tasks for a connector instance
* Restart connectors
* Restart connector tasks, including failed tasks
* Pause a connector instance
* Resume a previously paused connector instance
* Delete a connector instance

.KafkaConnector custom resources

KafkaConnectors allow you to create and manage connector instances for Kafka Connect in a Kubernetes-native way, so an HTTP client such as cURL is not required.
Like other Kafka resources, you declare a connectorâ€™s desired state in a `KafkaConnector` YAML file that is deployed to your Kubernetes cluster to create the connector instance.
`KafkaConnector` resources must be deployed to the same namespace as the Kafka Connect cluster they link to.

You manage a running connector instance by updating its corresponding `KafkaConnector` resource, and then applying the updates.
You remove a connector by deleting its corresponding `KafkaConnector`.

To ensure compatibility with earlier versions of Strimzi, KafkaConnectors are disabled by default.
To enable KafkaConnectors for a Kafka Connect cluster, you set the `strimzi.io/use-connector-resources` annotation to `true` in the `KafkaConnect` resource.
For instructions, see link:{BookURLUsing}#proc-kafka-connect-config-str[Configuring Kafka Connect^].

When KafkaConnectors are enabled, the Cluster Operator begins to watch for them.
It updates the configurations of running connector instances to match the configurations defined in their KafkaConnectors.

Strimzi provides an example `KafkaConnector` configuration file, which you can use xref:proc-deploying-kafkaconnector-{context}[to create and manage a `FileStreamSourceConnector` and a `FileStreamSinkConnector`].

NOTE: You can xref:proc-manual-restart-connector-str[restart a connector] or xref:proc-manual-restart-connector-task-str[restart a connector task] by annotating a `KafkaConnector` resource.

.Kafka Connect API

The operations supported by the Kafka Connect REST API are described in the {ApacheKafkaConnectAPI}.

.Switching from using the Kafka Connect API to using KafkaConnectors

You can switch from using the Kafka Connect API to using KafkaConnectors to manage your connectors.
To make the switch, do the following in the the order shown:

. Deploy `KafkaConnector` resources with the configuration to create your connector instances.
. Enable KafkaConnectors in your Kafka Connect configuration by setting the `strimzi.io/use-connector-resources` annotation to `true`.

WARNING: If you enable KafkaConnectors before creating the resources, you will delete all your connectors.

To switch from using KafkaConnectors to using the Kafka Connect API, first remove the annotation that enables the KafkaConnectors from your Kafka Connect configuration.
Otherwise, manual changes made directly using the Kafka Connect REST API are reverted by the Cluster Operator.
