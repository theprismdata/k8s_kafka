= Performing a restart of a Kafka connector

This procedure describes how to manually trigger a restart of a Kafka connector by using a Kubernetes annotation.

.Prerequisites

* The Cluster Operator is running.

.Procedure

. Find the name of the `KafkaConnector` custom resource that controls the Kafka connector you want to restart:
+
[source,shell,subs="+quotes"]
----
kubectl get KafkaConnector
----

. To restart the connector, annotate the `KafkaConnector` resource in Kubernetes.
For example, using `kubectl annotate`:
+
[source,shell,subs="+quotes"]
----
kubectl annotate KafkaConnector _KAFKACONNECTOR-NAME_ strimzi.io/restart=true
----

. Wait for the next reconciliation to occur (every two minutes by default).
+
The Kafka connector is restarted, as long as the annotation was detected by the reconciliation process.
When Kafka Connect accepts the restart request, the annotation is removed from the `KafkaConnector` custom resource.
