= Deploying the standalone User Operator

[role="_abstract"]
This procedure shows how to deploy the User Operator as a standalone component for user management.
You can use a standalone User Operator with a Kafka cluster that is not managed by the Cluster Operator.

A standalone deployment can operate with any Kafka cluster.

Standalone deployment files are provided with Strimzi.
Use the `05-Deployment-strimzi-user-operator.yaml` deployment file to deploy the User Operator.
Add or set the environment variables needed to make a connection to a Kafka cluster.

.Prerequisites

* You are running a Kafka cluster for the User Operator to connect to.
+
As long as the standalone User Operator is correctly configured for connection,
the Kafka cluster can be running on a bare-metal environment, a virtual machine, or as a managed cloud application service.

.Procedure

. Edit the following `env` properties in the `install/user-operator/05-Deployment-strimzi-user-operator.yaml` standalone deployment file.

----
<1> The Kubernetes namespace for the User Operator to watch for `KafkaUser` resources. Only one namespace can be specified.
<2>  The host and port pair of the bootstrap broker address to discover and connect to all brokers in the Kafka cluster.
Use a comma-separated list to specify two or three broker addresses in case a server is down.
<3> The Kubernetes `Secret` that contains the public key (`ca.crt`) value of the Certificate Authority that signs new user certificates for TLS client authentication.
<4> The Kubernetes `Secret` that contains the private key (`ca.key`) value of the Certificate Authority that signs new user certificates for TLS client authentication.
<5> The label selector used to identify the `KafkaUser` resources managed by the User Operator.
<6> The interval between periodic reconciliations, in milliseconds.
The default is `120000` (2 minutes).
<7> The level for printing logging messages.
You can set the level to `ERROR`, `WARNING`, `INFO`, `DEBUG`, or `TRACE`.
<8> Enables garbage collection (GC) logging.
The default is `true`.
<9> The validity period for the Certificate Authority.
The default is `365` days.
<10> The renewal period for the Certificate Authority. The renewal period is measured backwards from the expiry date of the current certificate.
The default is `30` days to initiate certificate renewal before the old certificates expire.
<11> (Optional) The Java options used by the JVM running the User Operator
<12> (Optional) The debugging (`-D`) options set for the User Operator
<13> (Optional) Prefix for the names of Kubernetes secrets created by the User Operator.
<14> (Optional) Indicates whether the Kafka cluster supports management of authorization ACL rules using the Kafka Admin API.
When set to `false`, the User Operator will reject all resources with `simple` authorization ACL rules.
This helps to avoid unnecessary exceptions in the Kafka cluster logs.
The default is `true`.
<15> (Optional) Semi-colon separated list of Cron Expressions defining the maintenance time windows during which the expiring user certificates will be renewed.

. If you are using TLS to connect to the Kafka cluster, specify the secrets used to authenticate connection.
Otherwise, go to the next step.

<1> The Kubernetes `Secret` that contains the public key (`ca.crt`) value of the Certificate Authority that signs Kafka broker certificates for TLS client authentication.
<2> The Kubernetes `Secret` that contains the keystore (`entity-operator.p12`) with the private key and certificate for TLS authentication against the Kafka cluster.
The `Secret` must also contain the password (`entity-operator.password`) for accessing the keystore.

`READY` shows the number of replicas that are ready/expected.
The deployment is successful when the `AVAILABLE` output shows `1`.
