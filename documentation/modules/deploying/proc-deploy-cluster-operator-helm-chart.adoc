= Deploying Strimzi using Helm

[role="_abstract"]
link:https://helm.sh/[Helm] charts are used to package, configure, and deploy Kubernetes resources.
Strimzi provides a Helm chart to deploy the Cluster Operator.

After you have deployed the Cluster Operator this way, you can deploy Strimzi components using custom resources.
For example, you can deploy the `Kafka` custom resource, and the installed Cluster Operator will create a Kafka cluster.

For information on upgrades, see xref:con-upgrade-sequence-options-{context}[Cluster Operator upgrade options].

.Prerequisites

* The Helm client must be installed on a local machine.
* Helm must be installed to the Kubernetes cluster.

.Procedure

+
[source,shell,subs=attributes+]
helm repo add strimzi {ChartRepositoryUrl}

. Deploy the Cluster Operator using the Helm command line tool:
+
[source,shell,subs=attributes+]
helm install {ChartReleaseCoordinate}
