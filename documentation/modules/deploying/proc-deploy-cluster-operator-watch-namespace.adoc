= Deploying the Cluster Operator to watch a single namespace

[role="_abstract"]
This procedure shows how to deploy the Cluster Operator to watch Strimzi resources in a single namespace in your Kubernetes cluster.

.Prerequisites

* This procedure requires use of a Kubernetes user account which is able to create `CustomResourceDefinitions`, `ClusterRoles` and `ClusterRoleBindings`.
Use of Role Base Access Control (RBAC) in the Kubernetes cluster usually means that permission to create, edit, and delete these resources is limited to Kubernetes cluster administrators, such as `system:admin`.

.Procedure

. Edit the Strimzi installation files to use the namespace the Cluster Operator is going to be installed into.
+
For example, in this procedure the Cluster Operator is installed into the namespace `_<my_cluster_operator_namespace>_`.
+

. Deploy the Cluster Operator:
+
[source,shell,subs="+quotes,attributes+"]
kubectl create -f install/cluster-operator -n _<my_cluster_operator_namespace>_

. Check the status of the deployment:
+
[source,shell,subs="+quotes"]
----
kubectl get deployments -n _<my_cluster_operator_namespace>_
----
+
.Output shows the deployment name and readiness
[source,shell,subs="+quotes"]
----
NAME                                READY  UP-TO-DATE  AVAILABLE
strimzi-cluster-operator-<version>  1/1    1           1
----
+
`READY` shows the number of replicas that are ready/expected.
The deployment is successful when the `AVAILABLE` output shows `1`.
