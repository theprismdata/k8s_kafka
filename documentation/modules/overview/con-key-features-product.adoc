= How Strimzi supports Kafka

Strimzi provides container images and Operators for running Kafka on Kubernetes.
Strimzi Operators are fundamental to the running of Strimzi.
The Operators provided with Strimzi are purpose-built with specialist operational knowledge to effectively manage Kafka.

Operators simplify the process of:

* Deploying and running Kafka clusters
* Deploying and running Kafka components
* Configuring access to Kafka
* Securing access to Kafka
* Upgrading Kafka
* Managing brokers
* Creating and managing topics
* Creating and managing users
