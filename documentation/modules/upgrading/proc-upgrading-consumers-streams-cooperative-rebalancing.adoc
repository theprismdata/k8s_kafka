= Upgrading consumers to cooperative rebalancing

You can upgrade Kafka consumers and Kafka Streams applications to use the _incremental cooperative rebalance_ protocol for partition rebalances instead of the default _eager rebalance_ protocol. The new protocol was added in Kafka 2.4.0.

Consumers keep their partition assignments in a cooperative rebalance and only revoke them at the end of the process, if needed to achieve a balanced cluster. This reduces the unavailability of the consumer group or Kafka Streams application.

NOTE: Upgrading to the incremental cooperative rebalance protocol is optional. The eager rebalance protocol is still supported.

.Prerequisites

* You have xref:proc-upgrading-brokers-newer-kafka-{context}[upgraded Kafka brokers and client applications] to Kafka {DefaultKafkaVersion}.

.Procedure

*To upgrade a Kafka consumer to use the incremental cooperative rebalance protocol:*

. Replace the Kafka clients `.jar` file with the new version.

. In the consumer configuration, append `cooperative-sticky` to the `partition.assignment.strategy`. For example, if the `range` strategy is set, change the configuration to `range, cooperative-sticky`.

. Restart each consumer in the group in turn, waiting for the consumer to rejoin the group after each restart.

. Reconfigure each consumer in the group by removing the earlier `partition.assignment.strategy` from the consumer configuration, leaving only the `cooperative-sticky` strategy.

. Restart each consumer in the group in turn, waiting for the consumer to rejoin the group after each restart.

*To upgrade a Kafka Streams application to use the incremental cooperative rebalance protocol:*

. Replace the Kafka Streams `.jar` file with the new version.

. In the Kafka Streams configuration, set the `upgrade.from` configuration parameter to the Kafka version you are upgrading from (for example, 2.3).

. Restart each of the stream processors (nodes) in turn.

. Remove the `upgrade.from` configuration parameter from the Kafka Streams configuration.

. Restart each consumer in the group in turn.
