= Using Prometheus with Strimzi

You can use Prometheus to provide monitoring data for the example Grafana dashboards provided with Strimzi.

To expose metrics in Prometheus format, you add configuration to a custom resource.
You will also need to make sure that the metrics are scraped by your monitoring stack.
Prometheus and Prometheus Alertmanager are used in the examples provided by Strimzi, but you can use also other compatible tools.
