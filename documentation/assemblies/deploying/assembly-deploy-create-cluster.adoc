= Create the Kafka cluster

[role="_abstract"]
To be able to manage a Kafka cluster with the Cluster Operator, you must deploy it as a `Kafka` resource.
Strimzi provides example deployment files to do this.
You can use these files to deploy the Topic Operator and User Operator at the same time.

If you haven't deployed a Kafka cluster as a `Kafka` resource, you can't use the Cluster Operator to manage it.
This applies, for example, to a Kafka cluster running outside of Kubernetes.
But you can deploy and use the Topic Operator and User Operator as standalone components.

NOTE: The Cluster Operator can watch one, multiple, or all namespaces in a Kubernetes cluster.
The Topic Operator and User Operator watch for `KafkaTopics` and `KafkaUsers` in the single namespace of the Kafka cluster deployment.
