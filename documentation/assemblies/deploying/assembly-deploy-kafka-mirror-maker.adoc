= Deploy Kafka MirrorMaker

The Cluster Operator deploys one or more Kafka MirrorMaker replicas to replicate data between Kafka clusters.
This process is called mirroring to avoid confusion with the Kafka partitions replication concept.
MirrorMaker consumes messages from the source cluster and republishes those messages to the target cluster.
