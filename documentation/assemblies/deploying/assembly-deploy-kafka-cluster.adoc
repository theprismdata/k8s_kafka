= Deploying Kafka

Apache Kafka is an open-source distributed publish-subscribe messaging system for fault-tolerant real-time data feeds.

The procedures in this section describe the following:

* How to use the Cluster Operator to deploy:
** xref:deploying-kafka-cluster-{context}[An _ephemeral_ or _persistent_ Kafka cluster]
** The Topic Operator and User Operator by configuring the `Kafka` custom resource:
*** xref:deploying-the-topic-operator-using-the-cluster-operator-{context}[Topic Operator]
*** xref:deploying-the-user-operator-using-the-cluster-operator-{context}[User Operator]
* Alternative standalone deployment procedures for the Topic Operator and User Operator:
** xref:deploying-the-topic-operator-standalone-{context}[Deploy the standalone Topic Operator]
** xref:deploying-the-user-operator-standalone-{context}[Deploy the standalone User Operator]

When installing Kafka, Strimzi also installs a ZooKeeper cluster and adds the necessary configuration to connect Kafka with ZooKeeper.
