= Tuning Kafka configuration

Use configuration properties to optimize the performance of Kafka brokers, producers and consumers.

A minimum set of configuration properties is required,
but you can add or adjust properties to change how producers and consumers interact with Kafka brokers.
For example, you can tune latency and throughput of messages so that clients can respond to data in real time.

You might start by analyzing metrics to gauge where to make your initial configurations,
then make incremental changes and further comparisons of metrics until you have the configuration you need.

For more information about Apache Kafka configuration properties, see the {kafkaDoc}.
