= Using the User Operator

When you create, modify or delete a user using the `KafkaUser` resource,
the User Operator ensures those changes are reflected in the Kafka cluster.

The _Deploying and Upgrading Strimzi_ guide provides instructions to deploy the User Operator:

* link:{BookURLDeploying}#deploying-the-user-operator-using-the-cluster-operator-{context}[Using the Cluster Operator (recommended)^]
* link:{BookURLDeploying}#deploying-the-user-operator-standalone-{context}[Standalone to operate with Kafka clusters not managed by Strimzi^]

For more information about the schema, see xref:type-KafkaUser-reference[`KafkaUser` schema reference].

.Authenticating and authorizing access to Kafka
Use `KafkaUser` to enable the authentication and authorization mechanisms that a specific client uses to access Kafka.

For more information on using `KafkUser` to manage users and secure access to Kafka brokers, see xref:assembly-securing-kafka-{context}[Securing access to Kafka brokers].
