= Configuring a Strimzi deployment

[role="_abstract"]
Configure your Strimzi deployment using custom resources.
Strimzi provides link:{BookURLDeploying}#deploy-examples-{context}[example configuration files^], which can serve as a starting point when building your own Kafka component configuration for deployment.

NOTE: Labels applied to a custom resource are also applied to the Kubernetes resources making up its cluster.
This provides a convenient mechanism for resources to be labeled as required.

.Monitoring a Strimzi deployment
You can use Prometheus and Grafana to monitor your Strimzi deployment.
For more information, see link:{BookURLDeploying}#assembly-metrics-str[Introducing metrics to Kafka^].
