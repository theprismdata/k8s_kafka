= Cruise Control for cluster rebalancing

[role="_abstract"]
You can deploy {CruiseControlProject} to your Strimzi cluster and use it to _rebalance_ the Kafka cluster.

Cruise Control is an open source system for automating Kafka operations, such as monitoring cluster workload, rebalancing a cluster based on predefined constraints, and detecting and fixing anomalies.
It consists of four main components--the Load Monitor, the Analyzer, the Anomaly Detector, and the Executor--and a REST API for client interactions.
Strimzi utilizes the REST API to support the following Cruise Control features:

* Generating _optimization proposals_ from multiple _optimization goals_.

* Rebalancing a Kafka cluster based on an optimization proposal.

Other Cruise Control features are not currently supported, including anomaly detection, notifications, write-your-own goals, and changing the topic replication factor.

Strimzi provides link:{BookURLDeploying}#deploy-examples-{context}[example configuration files].
Example YAML configuration files for Cruise Control are provided in `examples/cruise-control/`.
