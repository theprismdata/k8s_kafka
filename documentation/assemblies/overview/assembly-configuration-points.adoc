In this section we look at how Kafka components are configured through custom resources, starting with common configuration points and then important configuration considerations specific to components.

Strimzi provides link:{BookURLDeploying}#deploy-examples-{context}[example configuration files^], which can serve as a starting point when building your own Kafka component configuration for deployment.
