= Strimzi custom resource upgrades

When upgrading Strimzi to {ProductVersion} from {ConvertAfterProductVersion} or earlier, you must ensure that your custom resources are using API version `{ApiVersion}`.
You must upgrade the Custom Resource Definitions and the custom resources *before* upgrading to Strimzi {ConvertBeforeProductVersion} or newer.
To perform the upgrade, you can use the _API conversion tool_ provided with Strimzi {LastReleaseWithCRDUpgrade}.
For more information, see the {UpgradeGuide}.
