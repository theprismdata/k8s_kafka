= Downgrading Strimzi

If you are encountering issues with the version of Strimzi you upgraded to,
you can revert your installation to the previous version.

You can perform a downgrade to:

. Revert your Cluster Operator to the previous Strimzi version.
** xref:proc-downgrade-cluster-operator-{context}[]

. Downgrade all Kafka brokers and client applications to the previous Kafka version.
** xref:assembly-downgrade-kafka-versions-{context}[]

If the previous version of Strimzi does not support the version of Kafka you are using,
you can also downgrade Kafka as long as the log message format versions appended to messages match.
