= Introduction

This guide provides information to assist contributors to the Strimzi documentation.

Strimzi documentation is written in Asciidoc.

.Inclusive language

Strimzi is committed to using inclusive and respectful language in its code, web pages, and documentation.
Contributions to the documentation, as with code submissions, must not contain problematic terms or phrases.

== Documentation tools

The following tools are needed to build the documentation:

https://asciidoctor.org/[`asciidoctor`^]:: Documentation generation tool
https://www.gnu.org/software/make/[`make`^]:: Make build system to build complete documentation
https://github.com/mikefarah/yq[`yq`^]:: YAML build tool to build documentation using _make_ targets

Additionally, for generating the API reference you will also need:

https://adoptopenjdk.net/[`java`^]:: Java for building code and generating the API reference
https://maven.apache.org/[`mvn`^]:: Maven for running the Java build

For most documentation updates, `asciidoctor` offers the simplest way to check the build.

== Project layout

Strimzi uses git to manage repositories.

https://github.com/strimzi/strimzi-kafka-operator[`strimzi-kafka-operator`^] (GitHub):: The public GitHub repo hosts all of the Strimzi Operators code and documentation.
https://github.com/strimzi/strimzi-kafka-bridge[`strimzi-kafka-bridge`^] (GitHub):: The public GitHub repo hosts all of the Strimzi Kafka Bridge code.
https://github.com/strimzi/strimzi-kafka-oauth[`strimzi-kafka-oauth`^] (GitHub):: The public GitHub repo hosts all of the Strimzi OAuth 2.0 code.

The main documentation is in the Strimzi Operators repository, in the https://github.com/strimzi/strimzi-kafka-operator/tree/main/documentation[`documentation` folder^].
The _documentation_ folder is split into _category_ folders to manage the content.

Documentation category folders contain files related to Strimzi guides (Deploying, Quickstart, Overview, Using), and the files that provide the content for one or more of these guides â€“ _assemblies_ and _modules_.
Assemblies, which usually encapsulate a feature or process, bring the related content contained in modules together.

An assembly is like a sub-section or chapter in a book.
For example, the _Deploying and Upgrading Strimzi_ guide has a chapter called _Verifying the Strimzi deployment_, which is contained in its own assembly.

=== Strimzi Overview guide

The intention of the _Strimzi Overview guide_ is for developing an understanding of Strimzi and Apache Kafka.
The guide does not contain any instructions.
It provides an overview of the concepts behind Apache Kafka, the Kafka component architecture, and how Strimzi supports Kafka in a Kubernetes cluster.
The guide also describes how Strimzi _Operators_ help manage a deployment.

The guide contains high-level outlines of the processes required to deploy, configure, secure and monitor a deployment of Strimzi.

=== Deploying and Upgrading Strimzi

The _Deploying and Upgrading Strimzi_ guide provides instructions on all the options available for deploying and upgrading Strimzi.
The guide describes what is deployed, and the order of deployment required to run Apache Kafka in a Kubernetes cluster.

As well as describing the deployment steps, the guide also provides pre- and post-deployment instructions to prepare for and verify a deployment.
Additional deployment options described include the steps to introduce metrics.

Upgrade instructions are provided for Strimzi and Kafka upgrades.

=== Strimzi Quick Start guide

The _Strimzi Quick Start guide_ provides instructions for evaluating Strimzi using _Minikube_.
The steps describe how to get a Strimzi deployment up-and-running as quickly as possible.

In contrast to the _Deploying and Upgrading Strimzi_ guide, this guide provides a reduced set of instructions for a specific type of deployment, with minimal configuration.

=== Configuring Strimzi

The _Configuring Strimzi_ guide provides configuration instructions for Kafka components, and instructions for using Strimzi Operators.
The majority of the content relates to how you might want to modify your deployment and introduce additional features, such as Cruise Control or distributed tracing.

=== Custom Resource API Reference

The _Configuring Strimzi_ guide (documentation/using/configuring.adoc) also contains a _Custom Resource API Reference_ that describes the configuration properties for custom resources.

The _Custom Resource API Reference_ is built from two files.

.Custom Resource API Reference files
[source,asciidoc,options="nowrap"]
----
\include::modules/con-common-configuration-properties.adoc[leveloffset=+1]
\include::modules/appendix_crds.adoc[]
----

The `con-common-configuration-properties.adoc` file contains descriptions of common configuration properties.
The content for the `documentation/modules/appendix_crds.adoc` file is generated directly from descriptions in the Java code.

Java files in the `api/` folder are annotated so that the descriptions are picked up in the build.

.Java annotations for documentation
[source,java,options="nowrap"]
----
import io.strimzi.crdgenerator.annotations.Description;
import io.strimzi.crdgenerator.annotations.DescriptionFile;
----

The tables in `appendix_crds.adoc` are built from `@Description` annotations in the Java files.

Additional information is included by adding:

. An `@DescriptionFile` annotation to the Java file
. A corresponding description file (`.adoc`) in the `documentation/api/` folder
. An `include:__DESCRIPTION-FILE-NAME__` reference to the `appendix_crds.adoc`

The `include:__DESCRIPTION-FILE-NAME__` reference is added automatically by the Maven build, so you do not need to add it manually.

For example, to add additional configuration for the `KafkaUserQuotas` custom resource:

. `api/src/main/java/io/strimzi/api/kafka/model/KafkaUserQuotas.java` contains:
** `import io.strimzi.crdgenerator.annotations.Description`
** `import io.strimzi.crdgenerator.annotations.DescriptionFile`
** `@Description("_descriptions for individual properties..._");`
** An `@DescriptionFile` annotation
. `documentation/api` includes the `io.strimzi.api.kafka.model.KafkaUserQuotas.adoc` file containing the additional configuration description.
+
The description file requires the same name as the related Java package.
. `appendix_crds.adoc` contains a reference to include the additional configuration description:
+

### `KafkaUserQuotas` schema reference

/include::../api/io.strimzi.api.kafka.model.KafkaUserQuotas.adoc[leveloffset=+1]

If you change anything in the `api` module of the Java code, you must rebuild the _Custom Resource API Reference_ using a xref:make-tooling[make command].
