.User-replaced values

User-replaced values, also known as _replaceables_, are shown in _italics_ with angle brackets (< >).
Underscores ( _ ) are used for multi-word values.
If the value refers to code or commands, `monospace` is also used.

For example, in the following code, you will want to replace `_<my_namespace>_` with the name of your namespace:

[source, subs="+quotes"]
----
sed -i 's/namespace: .\*/namespace: _<my_namespace>_/' install/cluster-operator/*RoleBinding*.yaml
----
